Master's Thesis

This thesis delves into the pivotal task of classifying product reviews based on their underlying sentiment, namely positive or negative. To achieve this, we embark on a rigorous exploration of the performance of well-established machine learning algorithms. Our comparative analysis includes Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overarching goal is to unravel the strengths and  weaknesses of these algorithms in the context of sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights weaknesses of these algorithms in the context of sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. For this study, we harness a comprehensive dataset comprising customer reviews and ratings extracted from the vast realm of Amazon product reviews. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analysis (TA) techniques, we subject these reviews to meticulous scrutiny. The precision and recall of each algorithm are carefully evaluated and compared. Notably, our findings reveal that the Linear Support Vector Classifier model emerges as the frontrunner, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 91.21%. This result underscores the potency of SVM in sentiment analysis, offering a robust tool for distilling actionable insights from the abundance of consumer opinions. In conclusion, this thesis not only sheds light on the efficacy of traditional machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis but also equips decision-makers in the e-commerce landscape with a valuable compass for product reviews.
